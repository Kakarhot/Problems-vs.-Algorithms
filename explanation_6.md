In this problem, I have to write a code to find the maximum and minimum number and return the tuple of maximum and minimum numbers. So, to solve this question, I divide the array into two parts and compare the maximums and minimums of the two parts to get the maximum and the minimum of the whole array.

Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(1)
