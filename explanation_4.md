In this problem, I have sort an array which consist of 0, 1, 2 only in a single traversal. To solve this problem, first I create a low pointer at the beginning of the array and a high pointer at the end of the array, a mid pointer that starts at the beginning of the array and iterates through each element. If the element at arr[mid] is a 2, then swap arr[mid] and arr[high] and decrease the high pointer by 1. If the element at arr[mid] is a 0, then swap arr[mid] and arr[low] and increase the low and mid pointers by 1. If the element at arr[mid] is a 1, don't swap anything and just increase the mid pointer by 1. 

Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(1)
